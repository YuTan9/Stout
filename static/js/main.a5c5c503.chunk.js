We found out that by fixing the end points of skeleton to the position of the original motion will hit and look for optimal solution (minimal distance between the retargetted position and the original position of joints) will cause some un-natural glitch that the original motion doesn't have. (For example an optimal solution for knees may be behind the torso)",'By knowing the limitation of optimizing functions, we decided to try on GAN networks. We first do a feasibility test to see if GAN network are capable of producing skeletons. We trained with about 10,000 frames of different hand-leg ratio skeletons, and the results were quite promising. With a promising result from feasibility test, we decided to do motion retargetting with GAN network. We adopted Style GAN developed by NVIDIA, and tried to generate a series of frames that can ultimately be played as a smooth motion. This network first train in a lower resolution manner, and then gradually upgrade to 1024x1024. We planned to train with 10,000 kimg, but we were only able to train to around 7,000 kimg until the end of the semester. With an uncomplete training, the result was quite unsatisfying; and the grading professor regard our method as "not actually" achieving motion retargetting, because we didn\'t actually retarget the skeleton but reducing the problem from 3D to 2D producing a seemingly satisfying result.',"The words of the professor was frustrating but also very useful. There are no easy way on tackling a real world problem;  and if a problem is beyond one's capability, he should sharpen his skills.

I started the project by labeling a small portion of the data to train a <strong>Fasttext</strong> (word embedding) and a <strong>Jieba</strong> (word segmentation) model. Then with the models, I look for words with similar word embeddings to the manually labelled data, and label them accordingly. For example, say, I had already labelled "Facebook" as a company and "Google" has a similar word embedding as "Facebook", I would label "Google" as a company.',"The results from the Fasttext model were satisfying, but I put those tagged data into the ALBERT model anyway. We supposed the ALBERT model will not outperform the Fasttext model since we were feeding the data attained from Fasttext model, and, indeed, the results from ALBERT looked pretty alike with the results from the Fasttext results.","I confirmed that this approach (manually tagging a portion of data, labelling the whole dataset with Fasttext+Jieba, and feeding results to ALBERT NER) is feasible, despite the model definitely needs some tweaking to optimize its performance. Before I left Winbond, our team hadn't scrutinized if there were anything left untagged (false negitive) that were really important, but I did utilized Power BI to compare between the results from both Fasttext+Jieba and from ALBERT NER (true positives and false positives). Looking at the Power BI visualization on the prediction, the results aligned with our knowledge. However, since most of the data were tagged by the Fasttext model, it is possible that something important was left behind. By looking for those left behind and tagging corresponding entity to the words, the marketing team could perceive trends in the market with less noise and discover potential opportunities.","Although the two approaches got similar results, looking at the approaches themselves, the ALBERT NER model could be a better approach since it relied on only one model while the other approach needed both the Fasttext and the Jieba model performed well to obtain satisfying results.","The first figure shows the tag cloud of the <strong>Application</strong> entity.
